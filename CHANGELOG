* Changes to the `Contract` API:
    * `Contract.deploy()` parameter arguments renamed to args

      constructing with keyword arguments or positional arguments.
    * `Contract.pastEvents` now allows you to specify a `fromBlock or
      `toBlock.` Previously these were forced to be `'earliest'` and
      `web3.eth.blockNumber` respectively.
    * `Contract.call`, `Contract.transact` and `Contract.estimateGas` are now
      callable as class methods as well as instance methods. When called this
      way, an address must be provided with the transaction parameter.

      specifying an alternate address for the transaction.
