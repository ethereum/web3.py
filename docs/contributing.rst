Contributing
------------

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Web3.py! Read on to learn what
would be helpful and how to go about it. If you get stuck along the way, reach
for help in the `Python Discord server`_.


How to Help
~~~~~~~~~~~

Without code:

* Answer user questions within GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, or the `Python Discord server`_.
* Write or record tutorial content.
* Improve our documentation (including typo fixes).
* `Open an issue <https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/issues/new>`_ on GitHub to document a bug. Include as much detail as possible, e.g., how to reproduce the issue and any exception messages.

With code:

* Fix a bug that has been reported in an issue.
* Add a feature that has been documented in an issue.
* Add a missing test case.

.. warning::

  **Before you start:** always ask if a change would be desirable or let us know that
  you plan to work on something! We don't want to waste your time on changes we can't
  accept or duplicated effort.


Your Development Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

  Use of a virtual environment is strongly advised for minimizing dependency issues. See
  `this article <https://realpython.com/effective-python-environment/#virtual-environments>`_
  for usage patterns.

All pull requests are made from a fork of the repository; use the GitHub UI to create a fork.
Web3.py depends on `submodules <https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255>`_, so when you clone
your fork to your local machine, include the ``--recursive`` flag:

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/<your-github-username>/web3.py.git
    $ cd web3.py


Finally, install all development dependencies:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install -e ".[dev]"


Using Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Developing within Docker is not required, but if you prefer that workflow, use
the *sandbox* container provided in the **docker-compose.yml** file.

To start up the test environment, run:

.. code:: sh

    $ docker-compose up -d


This will build a Docker container set up with an environment to run the
Python test code.

.. note::

    This container does not have `go-ethereum` installed, so you cannot run
    the go-ethereum test suite.

To run the Python tests from your local machine:

.. code:: sh

    $ docker-compose exec sandbox bash -c 'pytest -n 4 -f -k "not goethereum"'


You can run arbitrary commands inside the Docker container by using the
`bash -c` prefix.

.. code:: sh

    $ docker-compose exec sandbox bash -c ''


Or, if you would like to open a session to the container, run:

.. code:: sh

    $ docker-compose exec sandbox bash


Code Style
~~~~~~~~~~

We value code consistency. To ensure your contribution conforms to the style
being used in this project, we encourage you to read our `style guide`_.

We use Black for linting. To ignore the commits that introduced Black in
git history, you can configure your git environment like so:

.. code:: sh

   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs


Type Hints
~~~~~~~~~~

This code base makes use of `type hints`_. Type hints make it easy to prevent
certain types of bugs, enable richer tooling, and enhance the documentation,
making the code easier to follow.

All new code is required to include type hints, with the exception of tests.

All parameters, as well as the return type of functions, are expected to be typed,
with the exception of ``self`` and ``cls`` as seen in the following example.

.. code:: python

    def __init__(self, wrapped_db: DatabaseAPI) -> None:
        self.wrapped_db = wrapped_db
        self.reset()


Running The Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A great way to explore the code base is to run the tests.


First, install the test dependencies:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install -e ".[tester]"

You can run all tests with:

.. code:: sh

    $ pytest


However, running the entire test suite takes a very long time and is generally impractical.
Typically, you'll just want to run a subset instead, like:

.. code:: sh

    $ pytest tests/core/eth-module/test_accounts.py


You can use ``tox`` to run all the tests for a given version of Python:

.. code:: sh

   $ tox -e py37-core


Linting is also performed by the CI. You can save yourself some time by checking for
linting errors locally:

.. code:: sh

   $ make lint


It is important to understand that each pull request must pass the full test
suite as part of the CI check. This test suite will run in the CI anytime a
pull request is opened or updated.


Writing Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We strongly encourage contributors to write good tests for their code as
part of the code review process. This helps ensure that your code is doing
what it should be doing.

We strongly encourage you to use our existing tests for both guidance and
homogeneity / consistency across our tests. We use ``pytest`` for our tests.
For more specific pytest guidance, please refer to the `pytest documentation`_.

Within the ``pytest`` scope, :file:`conftest.py` files are used for common code
shared between modules that exist within the same directory as that particular
:file:`conftest.py` file.

Unit Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unit tests are meant to test the logic of smaller chunks (or units) of the
codebase without having to be wired up to a client. Most of the time this
means testing selected methods on their own. They are meant to test the logic
of your code and make sure that you get expected outputs out of selected inputs.

Our unit tests live under appropriately named child directories within the
``/tests`` directory. The core of the unit tests live under ``/tests/core``.
Do your best to follow the existing structure when choosing where to add
your unit test.

Integration Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our integration test suite setup lives under the ``/tests/integration`` directory.
The integration test suite is dependent on what we call "fixtures" (not to be
confused with pytest fixtures). These zip file fixtures, which also live in the
``/tests/integration`` directory, are configured to run the specific client we are
testing against along with a genesis configuration that gives our tests some
pre-determined useful objects (like unlocked, pre-loaded accounts) to be able to
interact with the client and run our tests.

Though the setup lives in ``/tests/integration``, our integration module tests are
written across different files within ``/web3/_utils/module_testing``. The tests
are written there but run configurations exist across the different files within
``/tests/integration/``. The parent ``/integration`` directory houses some common
configuration shared across all client tests, whereas the ``/go_ethereum`` directory
houses common code to be shared among respective client tests.

* :file:`common.py` files within the client directories contain code that is shared across
  all provider tests (http, ipc, and ws). This is mostly used to override tests that span
  across all providers.
* :file:`conftest.py` files within each of these directories contain mostly code that can
  be *used* by all test files that exist within the same directory as the :file:`conftest.py`
  file. This is mostly used to house pytest fixtures to be shared among our tests. Refer to
  the `pytest documentation on fixtures`_ for more information.
* :file:`test_{client}_{provider}.py` (e.g. :file:`test_goethereum_http.py`) files are where
  client-and-provider-specific test configurations exist. This is mostly used to override tests
  specific to the provider type for the respective client.


Manual Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To import and test an unreleased version of Web3.py in another context,
you can install it from your development directory:

.. code:: sh

   $ pip install -eÂ ../path/to/web3py


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Good documentation will lead to quicker adoption and happier users. Please
check out our guide on `how to create documentation`_ for the Python Ethereum
ecosystem.

Pull requests generate their own preview of the latest documentation at
``https://web3py--<pr-number>.org.readthedocs.build/en/<pr-number>/``.


Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's a good idea to make pull requests early on. A pull request represents the
start of a discussion, and doesn't necessarily need to be the final, finished
submission.

See GitHub's documentation for `working on pull requests`_.

Once you've made a pull request take a look at the Circle CI build status in
the GitHub interface and make sure all tests are passing. In general, pull
requests that do not pass the CI build yet won't get reviewed unless explicitly
requested.

If the pull request introduces changes that should be reflected in the release
notes, please add a **newsfragment** file as explained
`here <https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/blob/master/newsfragments/README.md>`_.

If possible, the change to the release notes file should be included in the
commit that introduces the feature or bugfix.


Generating New Fixtures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our integration tests make use of Geth private networks.
When new versions of the client software are introduced, new fixtures should be
generated.

Before generating new fixtures, make sure you have the test dependencies installed:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install -e ".[tester]"

.. note::

    A "fixture" is a pre-synced network. It's the result of configuring and running
    a client, deploying the test contracts, and saving the resulting state for
    testing Web3.py functionality against.


Geth Fixtures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Install the desired Geth version on your machine locally. We recommend `py-geth`_ for
   this purpose, because it enables you to easily manage multiple versions of Geth.

   Note that ``py-geth`` will need updating to support each new Geth version as well.
   Adding newer Geth versions to py-geth is straightforward; see past commits for a template.

   If py-geth has the Geth version you need, install that version locally. For example:

   .. code:: sh

       $ python -m geth.install v1.10.23

2. Specify the Geth binary and run the fixture creation script (from within the web3.py directory):

   .. code:: sh

       $ GETH_BINARY=~/.py-geth/geth-v1.10.23/bin/geth python ./tests/integration/generate_fixtures/go_ethereum.py ./tests/integration/geth-1.10.23-fixture

3. The output of this script is your fixture, a zip file, which is now stored in ``/tests/integration/``.
   Update the ``/tests/integration/go_ethereum/conftest.py`` file to point to this new fixture. Delete the old fixture.

4. Run the tests. To ensure that the tests run with the correct Geth version locally,
   you may again include the ``GETH_BINARY`` environment variable.


CI Testing With a Nightly Geth Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occasionally you'll want to have CI run the test suite against an unreleased version of Geth,
for example, to test upcoming hard fork changes. The workflow described below is for testing only,
i.e., open a PR, let CI run the tests, but the changes should only be merged into master once the
Geth release is published or you have some workaround that doesn't require test fixtures built from
an unstable client.

1. Configure ``tests/integration/generate_fixtures/go_ethereum/common.py`` as needed.

2. Geth automagically compiles new builds for every commit that gets merged into the codebase.
   Download the desired build from the `develop builds <https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/>`_.

3. Build your test fixture, passing in the binary you just downloaded via ``GETH_BINARY``. Don't forget
   to update the ``/tests/integration/go_ethereum/conftest.py`` file to point to your new fixture.

4. Our CI runs on Ubuntu, so download the corresponding 64-bit Linux
   `develop build <https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/>`_, then
   add it to the root of your Web3.py directory. Rename the binary ``custom_geth``.

5. In ``.circleci/config.yml``, update jobs relying on ``geth_steps``, to instead use ``custom_geth_steps``.

6. Create a PR and let CI do its thing.


Releasing
~~~~~~~~~

Final Test Before Each Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before releasing a new version, build and test the package that will be released.
There's a script to build and install the wheel locally, then generate a temporary
virtualenv for smoke testing:

.. code:: sh

    $ git checkout master && git pull

    $ make package

    # in another shell, navigate to the virtualenv mentioned in output of ^

    # load the virtualenv with the packaged web3.py release
    $ source package-smoke-test/bin/activate

    # smoke test the release
    $ pip install ipython
    $ ipython
    >>> from web3.auto import w3
    >>> w3.is_connected()
    >>> ...


Verify The Latest Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To preview the documentation that will get published:

.. code:: sh

    $ make docs


Preview The Release Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: sh

   $ towncrier --draft


Compile The Release Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After confirming that the release package looks okay, compile the release notes:

.. code:: sh

    $ make notes bump=$$VERSION_PART_TO_BUMP$$


You may need to fix up any broken release note fragments before committing. Keep
running ``make build-docs`` until it passes, then commit and carry on.


Push The Release to GitHub & PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After committing the compiled release notes and pushing them to the master
branch, release a new version:

.. code:: sh

    $ make release bump=$$VERSION_PART_TO_BUMP$$


Which Version Part to Bump
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The version format for this repo is ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}`` for
stable, and ``{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{stage}.{devnum}`` for unstable
(``stage`` can be alpha or beta).

During a release, specify which part to bump, like
``make release bump=minor`` or ``make release bump=devnum``.

If you are in an alpha version, ``make release bump=stage`` will bump to beta.
If you are in a beta version, ``make release bump=stage`` will bump to a stable
version.

To issue an unstable version when the current version is stable, specify the new
version explicitly, like ``make release bump="--new-version 4.0.0-alpha.1 devnum"``.
