   :description: Python Web3 SDK for Ethereum and EVM blockchains

Introduction
============

Web3.py is a Python library for interacting with Ethereum.

It's commonly found in `decentralized apps (dapps)`_ to help with
sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, reading
block data, and a variety of other use cases.

The original API was derived from the `Web3.js`_ Javascript API,
but has since evolved toward the needs and creature comforts of
Python developers.
