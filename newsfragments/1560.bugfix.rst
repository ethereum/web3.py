Fixed hasattr overloader method in the web3.ContractEvent class by implementing a try/except handler
that returns False if an exception is raised in the __getattr__ overloader method 
(since __getattr__ HAS to be called in every __hasattr__ call). 

Created an Exception class called 'ABIEventFunctionNotFound', which inherits from both AttributeError and 
MismatchedABI, and replaced the MismatchedABI raise with a raise to the created class in the __getattr__ 
overloader method of the web3.ContractEvent object. 

Created the test scripts 'test_contract_events_hasattr.py' and 'test_contract_events_getattr.py'
