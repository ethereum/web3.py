Thread safety for batching and better consistency with ``PersistentConnectionProvider`` implementations:

  - Make request batching threadsafe by using ``contextvars.ContextVar`` rather than a global flag for setting the batching state.
  - Deterministically match responses with request ids for ``PersistentConnectionProvider`` batch requests.
